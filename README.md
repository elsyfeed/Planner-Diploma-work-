### Final words

It was very interesting to create this project despite all the difficulties that arose during development. I defended my thesis with 100/100 points and received a diploma with honors (considering that I have ADHD, I consider this an achievement). And when testing at individual stages of the application, I used it and planned tasks related to the completion of the thesis.
